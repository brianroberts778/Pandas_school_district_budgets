Option 2: PyCitySchools

Mock analyses of a school district's budgets and general student scores across math and reading. 
Analyses include a overall District Summary, School by School Summary, and a handful of more in depth views into budget effieciency and a...
...general layout of the academic performance of grades 9-12 in Reading and Math.

Generally, based on the top and bottom schools, in relation to passing both subjects, and each school's budget-per-student, spending more on students...
did not reflect better math and reading scores. These analyses did also not indicate that spending more per student increased the likelihood of passing these classes.

Also, based on the size of each schools' total student count, Small/Medium (defined in the analyses) schools had better grades on average and an increased likelihood of students passing both courses. This could be due to smaller classes allowing for greater focus on each student individually. Further analyses could be developed to see if any of the disctrict budget could be shifted into hiring more teaching staff to offset larger class sizes, but again, an even more in depth look on this data would be needed to solidify any hypotheses on this matter.
